# MEMORY.md - Session Memory

_Things you've learned across conversations. Update as you go._

## Facts

_(Key things you've discovered about the workspace, the user, the project.)_

## Decisions

_(Important choices that were made. Record the "why" so you don't revisit them.)_

## Patterns

_(Recurring things — how the user likes code formatted, common workflows, etc.)_

---

This is your persistent memory. Each session, read this first. Update it when you learn something worth remembering.
