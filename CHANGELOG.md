# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- _None yet._

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.5)

### Added

- **Explicit trust-model acceptance in onboarding**: Added a required security acceptance gate in onboarding before credentials are used, with operator confirmation token flow and policy metadata persistence.
- **Typed runtime config system**: Added `config.json` runtime configuration with schema-style normalization, safe defaults, validation, and first-run auto-generation (`config.example.json` as reference).
- **Runtime config hot reload**: Added file-watch based hot reload for runtime settings (including heartbeat/model/prompt-hook toggles) without full process restart for most knobs.
- **Security policy document**: Added `SECURITY.md` defining trust model boundaries, operator responsibilities, data handling expectations, and incident guidance.
- **Prompt hook pipeline**: Added formal prompt orchestration hooks (`bootstrap`, `memory`, `safety`) via `src/prompt-hooks.ts`.
- **MIT license**: Added a root `LICENSE` file with MIT license text.
- **HybridAI branding assets**: Added local HybridAI logo assets for landing page branding and navigation.

### Changed

- **Configuration model**: Shifted behavior/configuration defaults from env-only to typed `config.json`; `.env` now primarily carries secrets.
- **Prompt assembly architecture**: Replaced inline system-prompt composition in conversation/session-maintenance paths with the reusable hook pipeline.
- **Gateway heartbeat lifecycle**: Gateway now reacts to hot-reloaded config changes for heartbeat-relevant settings and restarts heartbeat accordingly.
- **Landing page positioning**: Refined site messaging toward enterprise value, security posture, digital coworker framing, and clearer USP comparison.

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.4)

### Added

- **Shared gateway protocol types**: Added `src/gateway-types.ts` to centralize gateway request/response types and command rendering helpers used by service/client layers.
- **Lint scripts**: Added `lint` scripts in both root and `container/` packages using strict TypeScript checks (`--noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`).
- **HybridAI onboarding flow**: Added interactive `hybridclaw onboarding` and automatic startup onboarding when `HYBRIDAI_API_KEY` is missing, with browser-driven account creation/login guidance, API key validation, and `.env` persistence.
- **First-run env bootstrap**: Onboarding now auto-creates `.env` from `.env.example` when `.env` is missing.

### Changed

- **Gateway-only Discord runtime**: `gateway` now starts Discord integration automatically when `DISCORD_TOKEN` is set.
- **CLI simplification**: Removed standalone `serve` command; Discord is managed by `gateway`.
- **Gateway API contract simplification**: Removed compatibility aliases/fallbacks for command and chat payloads; APIs now use the current request schema only.
- **Onboarding endpoint configuration**: Onboarding now always uses fixed HybridAI paths under `HYBRIDAI_BASE_URL` (`/register`, `/verify_code`, `/admin_api_keys`) without separate endpoint env overrides.
- **Onboarding prompt UX polish**: Registration/login prompts are now single-line and non-indented, with clearer icon mapping by step (`⚙️` setup/meta, `👤` registration/account choice, `🔒` authentication, `🔑` API key input, `⌨️` bot selection, `🪼` bot list title).
- **Onboarding login flow cleanup**: Removed the redundant standalone API key page info line and kept the browser-driven auth/key retrieval flow focused on one prompt per action.

### Removed

- **Legacy workspace migration shim**: Removed old session-workspace migration path handling from IPC bootstrap code.
- **Unused health helper**: Removed unused `getUptime()` export from `src/health.ts`.

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.3)

### Added

- **Gateway-first runtime**: Added dedicated gateway entrypoint (`src/gateway.ts`) and shared gateway service layer (`src/gateway-service.ts`) to centralize chat handling, commands, persistence, scheduler, and heartbeat.
- **Gateway client module**: Added reusable HTTP client (`src/gateway-client.ts`) for thin adapters to call gateway APIs.
- **Web chat interface**: Added `/chat` UI (`site/chat.html`) with session history, new conversation flow, empty-state CTA, and in-chat thinking indicator.
- **Gateway HTTP API surface**: Added `/api/status`, `/api/history`, `/api/chat`, and `/api/command` endpoints with optional bearer auth and localhost-only fallback.

### Changed

- **Adapters simplified**: Discord (`serve`) and TUI now operate as thin gateway clients instead of hosting core runtime logic locally.
- **CLI and scripts**: Updated command descriptions and npm scripts so `gateway` is the primary runtime (`dev`/`start` now launch gateway).
- **Gateway HTTP server role**: `src/health.ts` now serves health, API routes, and static web assets.
- **Configuration and docs**: Added gateway-related env vars (`HEALTH_HOST`, `WEB_API_TOKEN`, `GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `GATEWAY_API_TOKEN`) and updated `.env.example`/`README.md`.

### Fixed

- **TUI startup branding**: Restored the ASCII art startup logo in the TUI banner.

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.2)

### Added

- **Memory tool**: Added a new `memory` container tool with actions (`read`, `append`, `write`, `replace`, `remove`, `list`, `search`) for durable workspace memory files: `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Session search summaries**: Added a `session_search` tool that searches historical transcript archives and returns ranked per-session summaries with key matching snippets
- **Automatic transcript archiving**: Host now mirrors conversation turns into `<agent workspace>/.session-transcripts/*.jsonl` for long-term search and summarization
- **Session compaction module**: Added automatic conversation compaction with persisted session summaries and DB metadata (`session_summary`, `summary_updated_at`, `compaction_count`, `memory_flush_at`)
- **Pre-compaction memory flush**: Added a pre-compaction flush turn that runs with `memory`-only tool access to persist durable notes before old turns are summarized/pruned

### Changed

- **Prompt context assembly**: Discord, TUI, and heartbeat sessions now inject persisted `session_summary` context into the system prompt alongside bootstrap files and skills
- **Compaction execution model**: Discord and TUI now run compaction in the background after sending the assistant reply, preserving responsive UX
- **Configuration surface**: Added new `.env` knobs for compaction and pre-compaction flush thresholds/limits (`SESSION_COMPACTION_*`, `PRE_COMPACTION_MEMORY_FLUSH_*`)
- **Container runtime toolchain**: Agent container image now includes `python3`, `pip`, and `uv` in addition to existing `git`, `node`, and `npm` tooling

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.1)

### Added

- **Skills system**: `SKILL.md`-compatible discovery with multi-source loading (managed `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, project `skills/`, agent workspace `skills/`) and precedence-based resolution
- **Skill invocation**: Explicit `/skill <name>`, `/skill:<name>`, and `/<name>` slash-command support with automatic SKILL.md body expansion
- **Skill syncing**: Non-workspace skills are mirrored into the agent workspace so the container can read them via `/workspace/...` paths
- **Read tool pagination**: `offset` and `limit` parameters for reading large files, with line/byte truncation limits (2000 lines / 50KB) and continuation hints
- **TUI `/skill` command**: Help text and pass-through for skill invocations in the terminal UI
- **Example skills**: `repo-orientation` and `current-time` skills in `skills/`
- **Tool progress events**: Live tool execution updates streamed to Discord and TUI via stderr parsing, with a typed `ToolProgressEvent` pipeline from container runner to UI layers

### Changed

- **Container iteration limit**: Increased `MAX_ITERATIONS` from 12 to 20
- **Skills prompt format**: Switched from inline skill content to compact XML metadata; model now reads SKILL.md on demand via `read` tool
- **TUI unknown slash commands**: Unrecognized `/` commands now fall through to the message processor instead of printing an error, enabling direct `/<skill-name>` invocation
- **Read tool**: Replaced simple `abbreviate()` output with structured truncation including byte-size awareness and user-friendly continuation messages
- **Path safety**: `safeJoin` now throws on workspace-escape attempts instead of silently resolving
- **Tool progress UX**: Progress behavior is now built-in (no env toggles), Discord uses `🦞 running ...`, and TUI shows one transient line per tool invocation that is cleared after completion so only the final `🦞 tools: ...` summary remains
- **TUI interrupt UX**: `ESC`, `/stop`, and `/abort` now interrupt the active run and return control to the prompt; abort propagates through the host/container pipeline and stops the active container request promptly

### Fixed

- **Skill invocation in history**: Last user message in conversation history is now expanded for skill invocations, ensuring replayed context includes skill instructions
