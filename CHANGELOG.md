# Changelog

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.2)

### Added

- **Memory tool**: Added a new `memory` container tool with actions (`read`, `append`, `write`, `replace`, `remove`, `list`, `search`) for durable workspace memory files: `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Session search summaries**: Added a `session_search` tool that searches historical transcript archives and returns ranked per-session summaries with key matching snippets
- **Automatic transcript archiving**: Host now mirrors conversation turns into `<agent workspace>/.session-transcripts/*.jsonl` for long-term search and summarization
- **Session compaction module**: Added automatic conversation compaction with persisted session summaries and DB metadata (`session_summary`, `summary_updated_at`, `compaction_count`, `memory_flush_at`)
- **Pre-compaction memory flush**: Added a pre-compaction flush turn that runs with `memory`-only tool access to persist durable notes before old turns are summarized/pruned

### Changed

- **Prompt context assembly**: Discord, TUI, and heartbeat sessions now inject persisted `session_summary` context into the system prompt alongside bootstrap files and skills
- **Compaction execution model**: Discord and TUI now run compaction in the background after sending the assistant reply, preserving responsive UX
- **Configuration surface**: Added new `.env` knobs for compaction and pre-compaction flush thresholds/limits (`SESSION_COMPACTION_*`, `PRE_COMPACTION_MEMORY_FLUSH_*`)
- **Container runtime toolchain**: Agent container image now includes `python3`, `pip`, and `uv` in addition to existing `git`, `node`, and `npm` tooling

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/HybridAIOne/hybridclaw/tree/v0.1.1)

### Added

- **Skills system**: `SKILL.md`-compatible discovery with multi-source loading (managed `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, project `skills/`, agent workspace `skills/`) and precedence-based resolution
- **Skill invocation**: Explicit `/skill <name>`, `/skill:<name>`, and `/<name>` slash-command support with automatic SKILL.md body expansion
- **Skill syncing**: Non-workspace skills are mirrored into the agent workspace so the container can read them via `/workspace/...` paths
- **Read tool pagination**: `offset` and `limit` parameters for reading large files, with line/byte truncation limits (2000 lines / 50KB) and continuation hints
- **TUI `/skill` command**: Help text and pass-through for skill invocations in the terminal UI
- **Example skills**: `repo-orientation` and `current-time` skills in `skills/`
- **Tool progress events**: Live tool execution updates streamed to Discord and TUI via stderr parsing, with a typed `ToolProgressEvent` pipeline from container runner to UI layers

### Changed

- **Container iteration limit**: Increased `MAX_ITERATIONS` from 12 to 20
- **Skills prompt format**: Switched from inline skill content to compact XML metadata; model now reads SKILL.md on demand via `read` tool
- **TUI unknown slash commands**: Unrecognized `/` commands now fall through to the message processor instead of printing an error, enabling direct `/<skill-name>` invocation
- **Read tool**: Replaced simple `abbreviate()` output with structured truncation including byte-size awareness and user-friendly continuation messages
- **Path safety**: `safeJoin` now throws on workspace-escape attempts instead of silently resolving
- **Tool progress UX**: Progress behavior is now built-in (no env toggles), Discord uses `🦞 running ...`, and TUI shows one transient line per tool invocation that is cleared after completion so only the final `🦞 tools: ...` summary remains
- **TUI interrupt UX**: `ESC`, `/stop`, and `/abort` now interrupt the active run and return control to the prompt; abort propagates through the host/container pipeline and stops the active container request promptly

### Fixed

- **Skill invocation in history**: Last user message in conversation history is now expanded for skill invocations, ensuring replayed context includes skill instructions
