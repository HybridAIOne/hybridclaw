# HybridClaw Docs

This section turns the repo-shipped markdown docs into a browsable manual for
operators, contributors, and advanced users. Start with the section that best
matches what you need right now. In the browser docs shell, each page can open
its raw `.md` source directly or copy the full page markdown from the document
header.

If you want a raw-markdown entrypoint that links every docs page directly, use
[For Agents](./agents.md).

## Latest Highlights

- `hybridclaw auth login anthropic` configures direct Anthropic API access or
  the official Claude CLI transport, and `/model list anthropic` participates
  in the same provider catalog as the other remote providers.
- `hybridclaw agent config` imports platform-generated JSON agent definitions,
  bootstrap markdown, and optional profile images without requiring a `.claw`
  archive.
- Google Workspace API access is available through the bundled `gog` and `gws`
  skills with host-minted short-lived tokens from encrypted Google OAuth
  material.
- The bundled skills catalog includes `gh-issues` for issue-queue automation
  and `excalidraw` for editable diagrams.
- The browser chat route uses the console SPA shell and the gateway root opens
  the same chat surface.
